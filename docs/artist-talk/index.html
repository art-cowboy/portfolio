        <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
        <h3>I self identify as a "<span id="gender"><a href="#gender1">Genderf*cked</a></span>-<span id="cowboy"><a href="#cowboy1">Cowboy</a></span>-<span id="cyborg"><a href="#cyborg1">Cyborg</a></span>" in my artistic practice. 
            I'm a QUEER NONBINARY TRANS ARTIST making works that blend utilize technology as an extension of my body to blend ‘the real’ and ‘the virtual’, while embodying the spirit of CAMP that has existed in the history of the cowboy. My works utilize video, 3D/CGI, augmented reality, web-art, and performance to create blended reality experiences of varying degrees and varying forms.</h3>

    <div id="gender1">
        <a href="#top"><h2 id="gender">Genderf*cked</h2></a>
        <p>my work is, in part, a manifestation of my thoughts on gender/queerness/expression, relating to my own life, understanding and experiences of gender as well as how gender is presented and understood in pop culture and in media like film and television. I borrow from the gendered character archetypes presented in film in order to deconstruct gender and its facets in a way that is more  accessible to people because of the sort of shared cultural experience of film / television, and also how they affect how we understand gender in the ‘real’ world</p>

    <div id="cowboy1">
        <a href="#top"><h2 id="cowboy">Cowboy</h2></a>
        <p>the cowboy represents the spirit of CAMP present in my work, that can be directly tied to the history of the ‘cowboy’. Cowboy’s historically engaged in queer relationships, and even queerness as a concept is so related to the ethos of the cowboy,, finding ones own way outside of mainstream society, operating outside of the systems in place, having to find one’s company, you have to find those who understand you and what you feel and how you exist. I feel a lot of kinship with the concept of the cowboy. </p>

    <div id="cyborg1">
        <a href="#top"><h2 id="cyborg">Cyborg</h2></a>
        <p>my work is only made possible through my connection to the technology i use, the technology being an extension of my body and mind, as talked about by Donna Harraway in ‘A Cyborg Manifesto’. My work acts as an embodiment of this relationship between me and the technology, as without the technology the work doesn't exist, and without me there is no one to make that work, it's a symbiotic relationship</p>
