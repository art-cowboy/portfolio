  <h3> <span></span>A looping piece made to emulate the style of the Commodore 64, it uses the retro style of the early computer and the aesthetic of the CRT monitor to explore nostalgia and early ideations of gender. The idea of binaries is also confronted; i.e. what is a binary and what happens when you create a binary out of two things that don’t seem to be binary. What does it mean when we reduce complexities into two “opposing” sides, and how does viewing things in opposition frame them together and separately? The piece also takes reference to early internet culture and early 2000’s media to attempt an understanding of how these early depictions of gender have impacted Clark and their complex ideas of gender.</h3>
