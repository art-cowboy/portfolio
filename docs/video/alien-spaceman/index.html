   <h3> <span></span> <i>Alien+Spaceman</i> continues to explore the themes of gender performance and binaries through the lens of a wholly fictional 3D world. The characters of the Alien and Spaceman seem to be opposites in many ways, but come to embody very similar feelings and attitudes, this expressed through the motion capture performance by Clark as both the Alien and Spaceman. The piece explores gender through a more abstract means, as no longer are we dealing with pre-existing character archetypes, but are now creating our own based on amalgamations of these tropes and real life experiences and ruminations on gender. The binary evolves from man and woman to non gendered alien and non gendered spaceman, and how the see and interact with each other.</h3>
