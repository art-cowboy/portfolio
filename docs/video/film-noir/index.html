   <h3>
       <span></span> <i>A Film Noir</i> is an exploration of gender performance and character archetypes in film, specifically the genre of <i>Noir</i>. The piece is heavily inspired by Judith Butler's “Performative Acts and Gender Constitution” and the work of Cindy Sherman, the melding of the language of cinema and the gendered archetypes of the characters within cinema are reproduced in a tongue-in-cheek manner in order to see them more at face value, rather than subtextual/subconscious means that one normally might experience seeing a film. The video was produced in 2018, the first semester of their freshman year.
