    <h3>
        <span></span> <i>Geometry</i> is a culmination of the <i>Heartman</i> 3D project, and is a work in progress animation engaging in ideas of gender and transition over a lifetime. The piece is about two versions of one being, looking into the past/future, one dreamimg about what the future may hold, and the other reminicing about what came before. The piece speaks to an experience of trans people, one where as a child you cant imagine what a possible future looks like for you, and as an adult, being able to look back and re-evaluate your childhood experineces, and also to feel some kind of solace / catharsis for your younger self, knowing that where you are now is what you would have wanted as a child, or something to such an effect. 
        <br>
        This piece consists of 3D environmemts made by Clark Woods, as well as characters 3D modeled/textured by Clark. The animation in the piece was partially motion capture performance by Clark, and by-hand 3D animation. The triangle figure was done by hand animation to emphasize the awkwardness of youth and the feeling of not totally feeling right in ones current form, while motion capture used for the Heartman, as they have come into their own and are a confident and expeirenced figure. These two dance togther, being able to embrace both feelings/experineces as one being.
