   <h3> <span></span>This piece marks the first collaborative work between Clark Woodsâ€™s and their partner Melon Sprout, as well as the first video work made after the start of the pandemic. <i>T_SHOT</i> is a documentation of performance and an augmented reality video, as the fantasy penis that is applied to Melon was filmed in the video, and acts as a bridge between the real/virtual/fantasy. The fantasy penis also exists as a digital extension of the body and of gender, and the combination of fantasy gender and real gender affirmation (the titular testosterone shot) further blend what we see and know as real, and what it means to be trans and transitioning and passing, as well as the line between humanity and technology combining in more explorations of the cyborg and transhumanism.
