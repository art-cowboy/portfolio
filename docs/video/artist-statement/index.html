    <h3>
        <span></span>The title of this piece is the piece; an artist statement in video form for the year 2020, mere months before the pandemic. The piece/artist statement at the time relies heavily on Donna Harraway’s “Cyborg Manifesto”, which continues to resonate with the artist, but here takes a front seat. It also acts as a pseudo documentation of practice up til that point, with reference to other works made by Clark, as well as the gender story and life of Clark leading up to the piece.
