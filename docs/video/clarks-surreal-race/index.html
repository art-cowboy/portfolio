    <h3> <span></span> <i>Clark’s Surreal Race</i>  is a sort of parody work made by Clark during the pandemic as an exercise in making works with little resources, produced in their highschool bedroom while in a year long quarantine with their family in Oklahoma, the piece is similar to <i>
    Rio (2019)</i> in that it is more of an exercise of technique and silliness, and an excuse to perform in front of Clark’s beloved homemade green screen.</h3>
